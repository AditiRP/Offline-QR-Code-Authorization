# Offline QR Code Authorization
 The project is a web application designed specifically for access into food outlets within the campus . This application leverages React for the front-end and Flask for the back-end, creating a seamless and responsive user experience. The primary purpose of the application is to authenticate users, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the services provided by the campus food outlets.

A key feature of the application is the generation of QR codes, which allows users to access the menu even when they are offline. This offline access is particularly beneficial in environments where internet connectivity might be limited or inconsistent. By scanning the QR codes, users can easily view the menu options without needing an active internet connection, enhancing convenience and accessibility.
